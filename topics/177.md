## Overview

The examples below apply to Guild [user configuration](/reference/user-config). For a complete reference of remote configuration, see [Remotes Reference](/reference/remotes).

## SSH

The following is a minimal SSH remote configuration. Runs are located on the remote host under the Guild home `~/.guild` where `~` is the home directory for the default user associated with `remote-hostname`.

``` yaml
remotes:
  ssh-remote:
    type: ssh
    description: Remote runs
    host: remote-hostname
```

Note that `ssh` defaults are specified according to the SSH implementation on the local (client) system. Refer to the documentation for your SSH client for details on configuring defaults.

The next example defines additional SSH settings as well as a Guild environment.

``` yaml
remotes:
  production:
    type: ssh
    description: Production runs
    host: remote-hostname
    user: ubuntu
    port: 2222
    guild-env: ~/Envs/production
    init: test -e ~/Envs/production || guild init -y ~/Envs/production
```

Note that `init` defines a command that creates a Guild environment if one doesn't exist. Use `guild remote start production --reinit` to ensure that the environment is setup correctly before running Guild commands.

## EC2

The following is a minimal example of an EC2 remote:

``` yaml
remotes:
  ec2-v100:
    type: ec2
    description: NVIDIA V100 on EC2
    region: us-east-2
    ami: ami-0a47106e391391252
    instance-type: p3.2xlarge
    public-key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    user: ubuntu
```

## S3

The following example stores runs directly in `my-s3-production-runs` bucket.

``` yaml
remotes:
  s3-production:
    type: s3
    description: Production runs
    bucket: my-s3-production-runs
```

You can use `root` to store runs under a bucket path.

``` yaml
remotes:
  s3-test:
    type: s3
    description: Test runs
    bucket: my-s3-runs
    root: test

  s3-production:
    type: s3
    description: Production runs
    bucket: my-s3-runs
    root: production
```
