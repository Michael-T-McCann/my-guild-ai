## Overview

This [example](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/tree/master/examples/tensorflow2) illustrates how Guild works with TensorFlow and TensorBoard. It uses unmodified code from the official "beginner" example in [TensorFlow Overview](https://www.tensorflow.org/overview).

Project files:

|||
|-|-|
| [guild.yml](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/tensorflow2/guild.yml) | Project Guild file |
| [beginner.py](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/tensorflow2/beginner.py) | Sample code  |
| [beginner_with_flags.py](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/tensorflow2/beginner_with_flags.py) | Sample code modified to expose flags |
| [requirements.txt](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/tensorflow2/requirements.txt) | List of required libraries |

This example follows the process outlines in [*Use Guild in a Project*](/start/use-guild).

## Create Virtual Environment

Start with a new virtual environment. Use [`guild init`](/commands/init) or [another method](/docs/environments#create-a-guild-environment) as you prefer.

``` command
cd examples/tensorflow2
```

``` command
guild init
```

Activate the environment:

``` command
source guild-env
```

## Run the Sample Script with Python

Before adding Guild support, verify that you can run the beginner example without errors.

``` command
python beginner.py
```

The command should run to completion after training a model over 5 epochs. If you see errors, resolve them first. If you need help, [let us know](/new-topic?category=troubleshooting) and we'll help.

## Run the Sample Script with Guild

Run `beginner.py` with Guild:

``` command
guild run beginner.py
```

Guild runs the script to generate a *run*. When the operation is finished, show the run info:

``` command
guild runs info
```

By default shows information for the latest run.

Note the model `accuracy` and `loss` reflected in the result.

See [*Runs*](/docs/runs) for commands you can use with runs.

## Expose Flags

The sample script from Google uses a number of [hard-coded](/start/use-guild#hard-coded-hyperparameters) and [implicit](/start/use-guild#implicit-hyperparameters) flag values. We want to expose these so users can modify them without editing the code.

The following script parameters should be exposed as flags:

- Training epochs
- Learning rate
- Hidden layer activation
- Dropout

We modify the script to use global variables to define these values.

<div data-guild-github-select="5-8">

https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/tensorflow2/beginner_with_flags.py#L8
</div>

With this simple change, you can use Guild to run experiments with different hyperparameters. Each run is recorded with the applicable set of flag values.

``` command
guild run beginner_with_flags.py epochs=10
```

## Optimize Hyperparameters

Use Guild to search for optimial hyperparameters. By default, Guild tries to minimize the `loss` scalar. The sample script happens to log that scalar. If an operation logs something else, specify the scalar to optimize using `--minimize` or `--maximize` with [`guild run`](/commands/run).

Start a run to find optimal values for `learning_rate` and `dropout`. Train over two epochs to save time.

``` command
guild run beginner_with_flags.py --optimize \
  epochs=2 \
  dropout=range[0.1:0.9:0.1] \
  learning_rate=loguniform[1e-4:1e-1]
```

For more information about this command, see [*Hyperparameter Optimization*](/docs/optimization).

By default Guild runs 20 trials. Specify a different value using `--max-trials`.

Use [`guild runs`](/commands/runs) to list the runs:

``` command
guild runs
```

By default Guild shows the latest 20 runs. To show all runs, use the `--all` option.

Use [TensorBoard](/docs/tensorboard) to compare runs:

``` command
guild tensorboard
```

Click **HPARAMS** and **PARALLEL COORDINATES VIEW**. Select **Logarithmic** for **learning_rate**. Select **Quantile** for **accuracy**, **loss**, and **time**. This is a useful view for evaluating hyperparameters. Note runs with high accuracy and short run times. These are the "best" runs. To highlight these, click-and-drag along the vertical axis to select a region. Adjust the region as needed. TensorBoard highlights runs that fall within the selected range.

With these results, we make a some observations:

- This model learns quickly on the data set. We achieve solid performance with only two epochs.
- Optimal dropout appears to be around 10% at least over the short training period. We could experiment with higher dropout rates over longer runs.
- Optimal learning rate appears to fall between 0.001 and 0.01. This is with two epochs. We can expect the optimal value to change as we increase training.
- We can match the default performance from the Google example with just two training epochs. This reduces our time and energy cost by 60%.

You can expect break-through observations with other models. This is the value of experiment tracking.

With a base line to compare against, you might explore these questions:

- Can we improve the performance of the model with more training? We can test this by increasing `epochs` with the current optimal values for dropout and learning rate. We can run more optimization trials to see if the optimal values hold.
- Can we improve validation accuracy with more data augmentation?
- Do we need dropout? We didn't explore 0% but we should.
- Do higher levels of dropout show improved results with more training?

Experiments prompt questions, which prompt more experiments.

## Add a Guild File

Up to this point you run scripts directly. In this step you run an [*operation*](/docs/operations) defined in a [Guild file](/docs/guildfile).

https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/tensorflow2/guild.yml

The operation runs the `beginner_with_flags` Python module. It provides a description and default flag values.

List the project operations:

``` command
guild operations
```

``` output
train  Train a simple neural network to classify MNIST digits
```

Show help for the project:

``` command
guild help
```

``` output
OVERVIEW

    You are viewing help for operations defined in the current directory.

    To run an operation use 'guild run OPERATION' where OPERATION is one
    of options listed below. If an operation is associated with a model,
    include the model name as MODEL:OPERATION.

    To list available operations, run 'guild operations'.

    Set operation flags using 'FLAG=VALUE' arguments to the run command.
    Refer to the operations below for a list of supported flags.

    For more information on running operations, try 'guild run --help'.
    For general information, try 'guild --help'.

BASE OPERATIONS

    train
      Train a simple neural network to classify MNIST digits

      Flags:
        activation     (default is relu)
        dropout        (default is 0.1)
        epochs         (default is 2)
        learning_rate  (default is 0.002)

```

Guild files *document* project capabilities, as well as enable them.

Run the operation:

``` command
guild run
```

Guild trains the model using the optimal hyperparameter values. Compare the results to earlier runs:

``` command
guild compare
```

Use arrow keys to navigate the list. Move to the **accuracy** column. The accuracy of the latest run --- the run at the top of the listing --- should rank among the best results.

## Summary

In this example you train a standard TensorFlow example. The original code remains essentially unchanged. You improve the code with variables that define otherwise hard-coded hyperparameters. You don't import or use Guild modules. Instead you augment the project with a Guild file. This is all you need to enable a host of features.

For a more detailed step-by-step tutorial, see [*Get Started with Guidl AI*](/start). If you're already familiar with core Guild features (you learned a lot already in this example), skip to [*Use Guild in a Project*](/start/use-guild) for help applying Guild to your work.
