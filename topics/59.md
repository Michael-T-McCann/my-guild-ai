### Default Output Scalars

If `output-scalars` is not defined for an operation, Guild assumes the following:

``` yaml
train:
  output-scalars: '(\key): (\value)'
```

> **NOTE**
The values `\key`, `\value`, and `\step` (used below) are Guild-specific macros used to capture different types of values. You are free to use any regular expression pattern. These macros are conveniences.
>
> - `\key` is equivalent to `[^ \t]+`
> - `\value` is equivalent to `[0-9\\.e\\-]+`
> - `\step` is equivalent to `[0-9]+`

### Disable output scalars

Disable output scalars when you log scalars explicitly to summaries.

``` yaml
train:
  output-scalars: no
```

### Map Scalar Keys to Patterns

Use when you have a limited number of scalars or want to strictly control what's captured.

``` yaml
train:
  output-scalars:
    step: 'Training epoch (\step)'
    loss: 'Validation loss: (\value)'
```

### Capture Scalar Key

Capture both key and value by specifying two capture groups. Use whenever possible as this method automatically captures new scalars that match the format.

``` yaml
train:
  output-scalars: ' - (\key): (\value)'
```

> **NOTE**
The captured key is always the *first group* and value is the *second group*. ``\key`` and ``\value`` above are pattern templates and are not used to identify what is captured.
>
> To reverse the order, use named groups with names `_key` and `_val` for the key and value groups respectively.
>
>``` yaml
> output-scalars: '(?P<_val>\value): (?P<_key>\key)'
>```

### Named Capture Groups

Use named capture groups to specify the key for a particular pattern.

``` yaml
train:
  output-scalars: 'epoch (?P<step>\step) - train loss (?P<loss>\value) - val loss (?P<val_loss>\value)'
```

#### Multiple Output Scalar Specs

Use a list of specs as needed to define output scalars.

``` yaml
train:
  output-scalars:
    - 'Epoch (?P<step>\step)'
    - loss: 'loss: (\value)'
      acc: 'accuracy: (\value)'
    - '(\key)=(\value)'
```
