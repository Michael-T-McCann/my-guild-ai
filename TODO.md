# To Do

## Work on next

- Permalinks to docs
- Copy over some content - and get it close, will drive other topics
- Look for ways to glue together - prev/next links etc.

## Topics

### Guild AI Tweaks component

- CSS
- Move to GitHub when it's stable

### TOC Component

### Related Links and See Other Links

Once content is stabilized, fill in with cross references.

### Try to format commands and output with darker background color.

At least with a darker background it's suggestive of a terminal.

Even better would to support the `$` chrome.

### Glue docs together

This might be a TOC or Index. I'm guessing this would need to be a banner?

Also, how to navigate through the docs.

Solid progress by simply ordering categories.

### Permalinks

All docs and categories need permalinks.

### Transfer docs over

### Cleanup main site to point here

### Cleanup links

Once we have the site structure settled we need to go through everything and fix `cmd`, `ref` and `term` links.

### Integrated chat

It'd be nice to provide a real time experience for resolving issues with users. Slack has been great for this.

Approaches:

- Use a chat built into Discourse. Is there such a thing?
- Integrate with Slack somehow.

### Splash content on front page

Visiting anonymously shows unstructured categories. We need something to provide a good starting point.

Scenarios:

- Curious about Guild - send to main site
- Link to get started
- Link to docs

### Scheme to customize CSS without losing changes

### Header links

Consider this theme component:

https://meta.discourse.org/t/brand-header-theme-component/77977

### File tree widget

Nested unordered lists are rending meekly. How to show a formated tree structure?

### Apply consistent formatting

- Fig/table captions indented and italicized
- Avoid italics for links - or come up with a consistent rule - it seems inconsistent in the upstream docs

### Solution checkbox

In meta.discourse.org they offer a "Solution" checkbox, which designates a reply as a solution to a question. I think this would be useful on #general and #troubleshooting (possibly not others though).

## Done

### "Copy" code button

I saw this on meta.discourse.org so it should be possible.
