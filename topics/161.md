## Overview

Guild performs hyperparameter optimization by running trials in a [*batch*](/docs/runs#batches). A batch is a Guild operation that specializes in running trials. Each type of batch operation generates trials in a different way.

The batch operation is specified for a run using the `--optimizer` option with [`guild run`](/commands/run). The default optimizer is implicitly specified with `--optimize`.

As with any Guild operation, you can view help for a batch operation using `--help-op` with [`guild run`](/commands/run).

``` command
guild run gp --help-op
```

The following table lists built-in batch operations. Define your own batch operation and use it the same way.

| *Operation Name* | *Description* |
|-|-|
| [**+**](/docs/runs#default-batch-operation) | Generate a trial for each unique set of specified flag values |
| [**random**](/reference/optimizers#random) | Generate trials with flag values selected from specified distributions |
| [**gp**](/reference/optimizers#gp) | Sequential Bayesian optimization using Gaussian processes |
| [**forest**](/reference/optimizers#forest) | Sequential Bayesian optimization using decision trees |
| [**gbrt**](/reference/optimizers#gbrt) | Sequential Bayesian optimization using gradient boosted regression trees |
