# To Do

## Topics

### Avoid dead ends

This is a higher level idea, but we should avoid providing only info
without a "what to do with this" next step. E.g. while it's great to
talk about runs, let's also provide a link to get started with a
simple operation. When talking about output scalars, provide a link to
examples. These are all directing the user to apply the information
and get value from it.

### GitHub icons on header

This requires some code in Tweaks theme.

### www-pre -> main site on launch
### Fill in Examples

We lost the examples index. Need to fill out the content on my.guild.ai/examples.

### See Also

Lots of opportunities to specify "See also" references.

### Related Links and See Other Links

Once content is stabilized, fill in with cross references.

### Integrated chat

It'd be nice to provide a real time experience for resolving issues
with users. Slack has been great for this.

Approaches:

- Use a chat built into Discourse. Is there such a thing?
- Integrate with Slack somehow.

### Solution checkbox

In meta.discourse.org they offer a "Solution" checkbox, which
designates a reply as a solution to a question. I think this would be
useful on #general and #troubleshooting (possibly not others though).

### Bring over more examples
