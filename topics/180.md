## Overview

This [example](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/tree/master/examples/hello) illustrates basic Guild configuration.

Project files:

|||
|-|-|
| [guild.yml](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/hello/guild.yml) | Project Guild file |
| [say.py](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/hello/say.py) | Prints a greeting |
| [cat.py](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/hello/cat.py) | Prints contents of a file |
| [hello.txt](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/hello/hello.txt) | Sample file used by `hello-file` operation |

## Operations

### hello

The `hello` operation prints a message defined by a `msg` global. It illustrates Guild's integration with global variables.

`hello` as defined in `guild.yml` as follows:

https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/hello/guild.yml#L1-L6

The `main` attribute indicates that the operation is implemented by the Python `say` module.

Here's `say.py`:

https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/hello/say.py

Guild auto-detects that `say` uses global variables rather than command line arguments. Guild checks for the use of `argparse` by the module. If the module doesn't import `argparse`, Guild assumes that flags are defined as global variables.

> **NOTE**
> To set this explicitly, use `flags-dest: globals` operation attribute. For example:
>
> ``` yaml
> hello:
>   ...
>   flags-dest: globals
>   flags-import:
>     - msg
> ```

The `flags-import` attribute tells Guild to import only the `msg` flag. An alternative is to import *all* flags by specifying either `all` or `yes`:

``` yaml
hello:
  ...
  flags-import: all  # will detect `msg` as the only supported flag
```

Run `hello` with default flag values:

``` command
guild run hello
```
``` output
You are about to run hello
  msg: Hello Guild!
Continue? (Y/n)
```

The operation prints the following output:

``` output
Hello Guild!
```

Run with a different flag value:

``` command
guild run hello msg="Hello custom flag!"
```
``` output
You are about to run hello
  msg: Hello custom flag!
Continue? (Y/n)
```

The operation prints:

``` output
Hello custom flag!
```

View information for the latest run using `guild runs info`. This shows the run metadata including flags.

``` command
guild runs info
```

List files associated with the latest run using `guild ls`. This list is empty because the operation doesn't generate files.

``` command
guild ls
```

To view run output use `cat` with the `--output` option:

``` command
guild cat --output
```
``` output
Hello custom flag!
```

To view output for the original run:

``` command
$ guild cat --output 2
```

The value `2` indicates that the run with index 2 from `guild runs` should be used. You can alternatively specify the run ID to ensure you're viewing output for a particular run.

### hello-file

The `hello-file` operation prints a message from a file. It illustrates the use of a user-defined file as input to an operation.

Here's the definition of `hello-file`:

https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/hello/guild.yml#L8-L16

The operation is implemented in [`cat.py`](https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/hello/cat.py).

The `file` flag is used to specify the file used as input to the operation. The file is a [*dependency*](/term/dependency) and must be configured in the `requires` operation attribute.

From the example directory, run:

``` command
guild run hello-file
```

You can specify the file to use:

``` command
guild run hello-file file=hello.txt
```

The file requirement is named `file` to improve the message printed when resolving the resource.

For example:

``` output
Resolving file dependency
Using hello.txt for file resource
Reading message from hello.txt
Hello, from a file!
```

### hello-op

The `hello-op` operation shows how the result from an operation can be used by another operation.

By convention Guild refers to the required operation as *upstream* and the requiring operation as *downstream*.

`hello-op` requires output from `hello-file`. In this case, `hello-file` is the upstream operation and `hello-op` is the downstream operation.

Here's the definition of `hello-op`:

https://github.com/guildai/guildai/blob/master/examples/hello/guild.yml#L18-L29

When you run `hello-op`, Guild looks for a `hello-file` run. Guild creates links from `hello-file` in the run directory for the `hello-op` run.

To use a standard file name for input, the operation renames the upstream file to `hello.txt`. (This scheme assumes that `hello-file` contains a single file. If the run happens has more than one file, the first file, sorted in lexicographic ascending order, is renamed and subsequent files are skipped with a warning message.)

By default, Guild selects the latest non-error run for `hello-file`. You can specify an alternative run using the `hello-file` resource name:

``` command
guild run hello-op hello-file=<run ID>
```
